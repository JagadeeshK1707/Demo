git by Vamsi bhavani

one repository contain multiple branches   
we can create the multiple branches  that code is push into the main/master branch
we can create the multiple branches we can jump from the multiple branches
- git checkout -b "branchname"    = this is used to create the new branch and switch to new branch
- git checkout "branchname"	= used to switch existed branch
when we are pushing the branches select the particular branch 
-git push --set-upstrams origin branchName

-git remote -v  this command is used for the check the current repository
-git remote remove origin   = this command is used to remove the current repository
-git remote add origin  URL  = this is for adding the again url 
-git remote set-url origin URL  = this is the way to switch the URL from the current URL
-rm -rf .git   =     this commend for remove the git initiliation files in the nested repository
-git rm --cached -r collectionsSboot  =    removing the cached entry





total 4 stages are there 
1.working directory     - git status
2.staging area		- git add filename.txt    or  git add .
3.local repository	- git commit -m"message"
	now we have to add the remote repository nothing but url
			- git remote add origin URL
	
4.remote repository	- git push -u origin main

1.first we have to initialize the git by using command - git init
it shows the initilization of empty git repository
2.if check the git status we will get to know the untracked files - git status
3 - git add filename    is used for staging area
4 check the git status it shows the green the files what are the added
5 do git commit -m"message"
6 check the git status
7 now we have to add the remote repository nothing but url than check the git status
8 push the code to main branch - git push -u origin main

issues
if any branch problem check the branches -git branch
git push -u origin branchName
